# Pymaceuticals exercise

1. The Observations and insights requested for the homework is shown first.  There are 3 total.
2. The first steps in the code clean the data by the following removing the duplicate mouse.  
3. After calculating summary statistics across the whole dataset two different ways, the data is displayed in charts.  
4. The bar graphs show the total number of measurements for each drug regimen.  Two charts were created: one with pandas and one with matplotlib.  
5. The pie charts show the distribution of male vs female mice, again created with both pandas and matplotlib

### The rest of the data is spread across a subset of data for four specific treatments
   * Capomulin
   * Ramicane
   * Infubinol 
   * Ceftamin
1. Quartiles, upper bound, and lower bounds are calculated for each treatments
2. The calculations are then put into box whisker plots that show if there are any outliers
    * Only Ramicane shows any outliers
3. The tumor volume of a single mouse treated with Capimulin is shown.  t565 is used in this example
4. A scatter plot of average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen is shown
    * The correlation is calculated to go with the graph
    * A linear regression is added to the graph
    
**Note - If there are points taken off for anything, please specify why/for what so that I can learn from my mistakes.**  Thanks
