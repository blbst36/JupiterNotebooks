Analyzing purchase information for the game Heroes of Pymoli by gender and age.  If I am docked points for something, can you please include it in the comments when grading?  Thanks

You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
1. Final Critic is the most purchased item and the most profitable
2. Players between the ages of 20 and 24 spent the most money in the game and they make up the most players
3. Males players make up more than half of all players

I used different techniques to gather the data including merging data frames and using .agg function for multiple calculations on the same grouped data
I formatted all of the data as shown in the starter so that it is easier to read and confirmed that all of the numbers match exactly
